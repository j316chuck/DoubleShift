This project was bootstrapped with [Chrome Extension CLI](https://github.com/dutiyesh/chrome-extension-cli)

## TODOS!!
- Better ui! it is pretty shitty at the moment, displays only one
option in a preitty ugly fashion
- Better prompting! Both in terms of finding a good prefix and also
  formatting the html that the extension scrapes off of gmail. Check the
  console for example of the request being sent to openai. 
- Context! Perhaps there are ways of fine-tuning the ai based on your
  previous emails to imitate your style?
- tbd... lmk which u want to work on
