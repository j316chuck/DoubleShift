Communication takes time. :clock1:

Responding to lengthy recruiting emails, texting your friends dinner plans, messaging your boss what you did this week all take **time**. :alarm_clock:  

Don't you wish there was a **fast** way that you could respond to all these communication channels **effectively** and **efficiently**? :pray:

Well look no further, ***DoubleShift*** is here!  :raised_hands:

By running the double_shift module with the command: `python3 double_shift.py` and then typing `shift shift` in **any** situation you want to reply **quickly** to :fast_forward:;

You can generate a response to any conversation on your *current* screen in a **variety** of ways in a matter of **seconds** :running:.
